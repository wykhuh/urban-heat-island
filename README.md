# San Diego Urban Heat Island

Map produced for the [Urban Heat Island Hackathon](http://urbancanopy.io/tutorial), October 17-18 2020.

Our team downloaded temperature data from [NASA ECOSTRESS](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov) for San Diego. We processed the GEOTIFF using QGIS. And we did a comparison of temperature, tree canopy, public parks, and low and moderate income areas.
